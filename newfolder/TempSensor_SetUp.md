## Temperature Sensor Set up
### How to measure temperature?
To measure temperature, we use the NCIR unit. NCIR stands for Non-contact Infrared Thermometer, it can be used to measure the surface temperature of a human body or other object. 
This sensor measures infrared light bouncing off remote objects, so it can sense temperature without having to touch them physically. 
Simply point the sensor towards what you want to measure, and it will detect the temperature by absorbing IR waves emitted. 

### NCIR Unit Set up
1. Make sure your M5Stack is connected to the computer with USB to Type C Data Transfer Cable.
2. With the Grove Cable Wire, plug in your NCIR Unit to M5Stack via Port A. <br/> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56757186/110609638-6140a180-81c8-11eb-8eb0-7bc920475c46.jpg">
