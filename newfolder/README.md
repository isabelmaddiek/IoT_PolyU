IFTTT stands for "If This Then That", a company that provides a software platform that connects apps, devices and services from different developers, in order to trigger one or more automations involving those apps, devices and services. In this example, we use "If Room Temperature Higher than Certain Degree, Then Send Notification to Mobile Phone through IFTTT". The automations are accomplished via applets that connectS multiple apps to run automated tasks.
